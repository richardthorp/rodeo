### Colour Scheme
![Colour palette from https://www.coolors.co](static/images/readme-images/colour-palette.jpg "Colour palette from https://www.coolors.co")
The colours found throughout the website were selected using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) colour scheme generator. I created new with the generator until I found one that featured a selection of bright and lively, but not garish colours.
The 'Pine Green' colour found in the header and footer provides a strong background on which brings clarity to the bold white logo and links. The colour is also used for all button elements found throughout the website which brings consistancy and allows the user to quickly see that the elements are interative.
The bright yellow 'Citrine' colour is used as a background to the main body of the website. This colour contrasts well with the 'Pine Green' header and footer, and provides a bright, fresh and natural feel to the site.
The lighter 'Blond' colour works well against the 'Citrine' to highlight different aspects of the website to the user, such as the recipe cards and containers for the search and filter elements. The lightness of the shade allows for the black font, any clickable 'Pine Green' buttons and recipe images to to stand out from the background.

### Fonts
The font used for the 'Rodeo' logo is 'Young Heart', sourced from [wfonts](https://www.wfonts.com/). The font was chosen because of it's similaries to old western wanted posters which fits the branding of the hot sauce. As well as this, the font is decorative and more interesting than standard block lettering, whilst still being clearly legible. This also meant the font could be used throughout the website for the main navigational links and headings.

The font 'Bevan' is used in all sub-headers and buttons thoughout the website. This font was sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Once again, this font was chosen because of it's similarities to old western wanted posters. The font is clear and striking, making it very effective at breaking up the page with sub-headers.

For the rest of the site, 'Open Sans' was used due to its clean and clear style. The recipe instructions and ingredients and rendered with this font as it is clear and easy to read, even at small font sizes. This font was also sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
